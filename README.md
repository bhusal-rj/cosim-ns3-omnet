# CoSim - Network Simulator Co-simulation Library

CoSim is a lightweight co-simulation library that enables seamless integration between ns-3 and OMNeT++ network simulators. This library allows researchers and developers to leverage the strengths of both simulators in a single simulation environment, combining ns-3's detailed protocol implementations with OMNeT++'s modular architecture and visualization capabilities.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Communication**: Real-time data exchange between ns-3 and OMNeT++ simulation instances
- **Synchronized Execution**: Coordinated simulation time management across both simulators
- **Flexible Integration**: Support for various network topologies and protocol stacks
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple API for setting up co-simulation scenarios

## Use Cases

- Hybrid network simulations combining different network segments
- Cross-validation of simulation results between simulators
- Leveraging specialized features from both ns-3 and OMNeT++
- Research scenarios requiring the unique capabilities of each simulator
